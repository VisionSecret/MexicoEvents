# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to your project! Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Optional, for version control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd <your-project-folder>
   ```
   *If you received the project as a ZIP file, extract it and open the folder in your terminal.*

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all required `node_modules`.

## Running the Project

### Start Development Server
To run the project in development mode, use:
```sh
npm run dev
```
The server will start, and you can view the project in your browser at:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
*(Port may vary depending on the framework used.)*

### Build for Production
To generate an optimized production build:
```sh
npm run build
```

### Running Production Server
To start the production server after building:
```sh
npm start
```

## Additional Notes
- If you face permission issues, try running `npm install` with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or run your terminal as administrator (Windows).
- If any issues occur, try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and reinstall dependencies:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json  # macOS/Linux
  del node_modules package-lock.json      # Windows (Command Prompt)
  npm install
  ```
- Make sure `.env` files (if required) are correctly configured.
